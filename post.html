                <p id="p1">Art has been with us from the beginning.
                    It has been there with us at every step of the way, 
                    because <strong> a way being human, means being artist.</strong>
                </p>
                <h3 id="h3-1">Art is good for you
                </h3><!--<q></q> in p2-->
                <p id="p2">There is not such a division as the art we make and the person we are. 
                        The art we make is the person we are and vice versa. 
                        Now, one could say, <q>this is a bit too much, what happens if you are not making art, 
                        do you suggest that this means that we are none at all?</q> 
                        and no, obviously I am not suggesting that. 
                        What I am suggesting is that not making art, means in a way not expressing ourselves, 
                        and this has nothing to do with the lack of existence, 
                        and everything to do with the lack of training, confidence, and proper mentality about art.
                        Another thing that not making art means, 
                        <strong> not having the luxury of a playground that is at the same a testing tube for new things and ideas.</strong> 
                        There are correlations, I assume, between the ideas and the way our brain is thinking and the physical manifestations that our art is taking. 
                        There is a matter of physical skill of course, yes, but at the same time it is also a matter of thinking skill and organizing thoughts and information.
                </p>
                <h3 id="h3-2">I think that the problem is partially social.
                </h3>
                <p id="p3">One could say that art has been a thing for the <i>professional artists</i> 
                        and them who may earn money from their art. 
                        This mentality deprived us from the positive benefits that a culture fuller of art would provide. 
                        Expression is a need of humans and is so strong that does not go away if you do not get to have it. 
                        It becomes a void that consumes, atomizes and, in a mental and social level, scars us.
                        It would be interested if you, reader, 
                        could read about the benefits of expressing ourselves through making art. 
                        Unfortunately, I cannot give you the pleasure of such a reading, I am not smart enough for that; 
                        plus this is just something I started writing to do my <i>Udacity</i> course for front end developing with- 
                        but I am certain that someone else will. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="h3-3">What I am trying to stress here, is ...
                </h3>
                <p id="p4"><u>do not be closing your ears to the inner voices and 
                        do not be easy at discarding the possibility of imagining yourself as an artist;</u> 
                        there is always something to be gained, and that something, 
                        I suggest, is so vital that one needs to consider very seriously their relationship with creativity.
